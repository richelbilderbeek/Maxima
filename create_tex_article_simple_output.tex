\section{Introduction}

Writing scientific articles is commonly done with \LaTeX.
Algebraic manipulations can be done by a CAS, for example Maxima, Maple or Mathematica.
Of these examples, Maxima is the only free and open-source program.
Would it be possible to write a \LaTeX article within Maxima?
If yes, would it be elegant enough?

\section{Materials and methods}

A script executes the process from Maxima file to \LaTeX-formatted document in two steps.
The first step executes the Maxima script to create a \LaTeX (.tex) file.
The second step converts the \LaTeX file to Portable Document Format (.pdf).
The script does not require user intervention.

The Maxima script consists out of two parts:
algebraic manipulations and \LaTeX output

The algebraic manipulations demonstrated are: 
(1) defining a function
(2) calculate its derivative and,
(3) plot this derivative.

The second part uses these algebraic results to create a \LaTeX (.tex) file.
It creates an article displaying the formula's, the single plot in
the Results section.
In the Appendix, it shows: 
(1) the bash script to create a PDF from the Maxima script
(2) the Maxima script
(3) the generated \LaTeX code

\section{Results}

This is the formula for f:

$$f\left(x\right)=x^3+2\,x^2+3\,x+4$$

This is the formula for g, the derivative of f to x:

$$g\left(x\right)=3\,x^2+4\,x+3$$

Which looks plotted as such:
